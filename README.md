# Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Portfolio**! This repository showcases a collection of projects I completed as part of my coursework and independent learning in machine learning and data science. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world datasets, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to advanced modeling and evaluation.

## About Me
I am a recent graduate with a **Master of Science in Applied Data Science** from the University of Southern California (USC). My coursework and projects have equipped me with strong skills in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization**, as well as hands-on experience with tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau.

I am passionate about solving complex problems using data-driven approaches and am currently seeking full-time opportunities in **data science**, **machine learning engineering**, or **data analysis**.
